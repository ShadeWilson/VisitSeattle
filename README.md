# VisitSeattle

Ever felt overwhelmed when visiting a new city and didn't know where to go? Or wanted to know what a local would 
recommend if they were in your shoes? Visit Seattle aims to gives tourists insight into the best spots to check out
in Seattle, ripe with pictures, decriptions, and crucial information like addresses, prices, and more. 
As you go around visiting sights, you can also check them off in the app so you're sure you leave no stone unturned.

This app was helped along by the iOS courses on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).

A work in progress.
