# VisitSeattle

Ever felt overwhelmed when visiting a new city and didn't know where to go? Or wanted to know what a local would 
recommend if they were in your shoes? Ripe with pictures, decriptions, and crucial information like addresses, prices, 
and more, Visit Seattle aims to give you insight into the best spots to check out in the city to get you on 
your feet and where you want to go. As you go around visiting sights, you can also check them off in the app to be 
sure you leave no stone unturned.

This app was helped along by the iOS courses on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).

*A work in progress.*
